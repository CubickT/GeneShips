# GeneShips

Made with [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) generated using [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

2D genetic algorithm simulation about evolution of battleships, submarines and other naval vessels. Watch as ships
evolve through generations with realistic physics and tactical combat.

### Current status: Early development

### Planed features

- Genetic evolution of ship designs through natural selection
- Naval battles with semi-realistic physics and collisions
- Naturally achieved biodiversity
- Tactical AI
- Race mode for testing ship performance
- Multiple gamemodes with different settings
